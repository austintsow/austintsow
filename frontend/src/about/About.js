        "i'm a builder at heart, always drawn to the intersection of technology and problem-solving. my journey started in sammamish, just thirty minutes east from seattle, where i grew up surrounded by a mix of innovation and nature. now, i'm an undergraduate student at gonzaga university, studying computer science with a concentration in software security. i focus on ai-driven applications, blending machine learning to create intuitive, efficient solutions. outside of software, i'm deeply interested in web3, particularly in decentralized finance (defi) and solana's role in building a more scalable, permissionless financial ecosystem. the idea of rearchitecting trust and ownership on-chain is something i continue to explore.",
        "when i'm not working on projects, you'll find me outside. i spend weekends hiking in the pacific northwest, exploring trails across washington, always chasing new views and elevation gains. running has become a constant, whether training for a race or just clearing my mind on a long stretch of road. movement keeps me grounded, a balance to the hours spent coding.",
        "i also love cookingâ€”experimenting with flavors, refining techniques, and bringing people together over food. it's a creative outlet, much like design and development, where precision meets intuition. whether it's perfecting a dish or fine-tuning a piece of code, i'm always iterating, always learning."
