            <p id="aboutTextBio">Hello, I am Austin Tsow! I am an undergraduate student at Gonzaga University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science, in Computer Science. I am a highly motivated, result-oriented individual with a strong passion for using technology to solve real-world problems.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">In my previous roles, I have demonstrated my ability to learn new technologies, as well as systems and operations. As a Data Analyst at Century 21, I was responsible for analyzing real estate listings by pulling data from local multiple listing services (MLS) into Excel. I used this data to provide daily updates on real estate activity locally, including new listings, pending sales, and sold properties. As a waiter at Shanghai Garden, I developed a new system to improve restaurant operations which resulted in a 35% increase in overall efficiency.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">I have experience in various programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with debugging, Linux, full-stack web development, and backend software development. I have used my skills to build websites, small projects, and solve complex problems using machine learning. I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on the worldâ€”specifically, areas of education, healthcare, and sustainability.</p>

            <p id="aboutTextBio">I am an inclusive, disciplined, and resilient individual. Born in the suburbs of Washington, raised in Taiwanese culture. I have always been involved in some sort of physical activity. Playing 10 years of football, coming to a close as I started my college  in computer science. I have always been fascinated by how technology can be used to positively impact the world. I am interested more in the back-end of software development and engineering. I hope to first finish my Bachelor's degree, then become a Software Engineer. With that being the reason why I chose to study Computer Science. I believe that there isn't anything I can't do, and anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing.</p>

            <p id="aboutTextBio">In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, programming, listening to music, reading, and hanging out with my girlfriend Wynne! I recently picked up reading and just finished Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman. Great read in my opinion! Now reading Principles by Ray Dalio which should be a good read. I say <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/atsow_25" target="_blank" id="spotifyExternal">Spotify</a> > any other streaming platform. My current top three artists are Drake, Eem Triplin, and LUCKI. My favorite hike of all time would be Blanca Lake located in the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness Area in the Cascade Mountains. The green water is just so beautifulðŸ™‚.</p>
