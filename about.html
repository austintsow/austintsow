            <p id="aboutTextBio">Hello, I am Austin Tsow! I am a current undergraduate student at Gonzaga University, studying Computer Science. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science, in Computer Science planning to graduate May of 2025. Although I am prioritizing school work, I am currently working on two projects (this and a machine learning project) both as learning/passion projects. On the side, I enjoy spending time with family, playing video games (<a href="https://polytopia.io/" target="_blank" id="aboutExternal">Polytopia</a> being a current favorite), solving rubik's cube's, cooking, hiking, and anything outdoors. I found programming fascinating at a young age, and have kept up ever since.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">I consider myself beyond blessed to have the learning opportunities given to me at such a young age. As an avid enjoyer of learning new algorithms and data structures as a computer science major, I understand the time and patience firsthand. Having a keyboard to type and using it to potentially solve real-world problems would make my younger self thrilled for what his future holds. While learning both mathematics and computer science, has given me a solid academic foundation to build upon. One day I hope to use my education to help the greater good of humanity.

            <p id="aboutTextBio">I usually spend time listening to music on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/atsow_25" target="_blank" id="spotifyExternal">Spotify</a>, programming, cooking, or hanging out with my girlfriend, Wynne! My top three artists that I listen to right now are Drake, Don Toliver, and NewJeans. I also make a fire chicken or steak fried rice. I would say that I am a foodie and love trying new places around my area. My favorite foods are Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, hot pot, and sushi!</p>
