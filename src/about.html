            <p id="aboutTextBio">Hello, I am Austin Tsow! I am a current undergraduate student pursuing computer science, based in Sammamish, Washington, but currently in Spokane, Washington. I am a highly motivated, result-oriented individual passionate about building innovative software solutions.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">In my previous roles, I have demonstrated my ability to learn new technologies, as well as systems and operations. In my role as a Data Analyst at Century 21, I was responsible for analyzing real estate listings by pulling data from local multiple listing services (MLS) into Excel. I used this data to provide daily updates on real estate activity locally, including new listings, pending sales, and sold properties. As a waiter at Shanghai Garden, I developed a new system to improve restaurant operations which resulted in a 35% increase in overall efficiency.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">I have experience in various programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with debugging, Linux, full-stack web development, and backend software development. My skills have enabled me to build websites, small projects, and solve complex problems using machine learning. I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on the worldâ€”specifically, areas of education, healthcare, and sustainability.</p>

          <div id="aboutMidDiv">
            <p id="aboutTextBio">I am an inclusive, disciplined, and resilient individual. Born and raised in the suburbs of Washington, immersed in Taiwanese culture. I have always been involved in some sort of physical activity. After playing football for 10 years as I started my college career in computer science. Technology's potential to positively impact the world has always fascinated me. I am interested more in the back-end of software development and engineering. I hope to first finish my Bachelor's degree, then become a Software Engineer. With that being the reason why I chose to study Computer Science. I believe that there isn't anything I can't do, and anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing.</p>

          <div id="aboutMidDiv">
            <p id="aboutTextBio">In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, programming, listening to music, reading, and hanging out with my girlfriend Wynne! I recently picked up reading and just finished Principles by Ray Dalio. In my opinion, it is by far the best book I have read! I am now reading Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. I say <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/atsow_25" target="_blank" id="spotifyExternal">Spotify</a> > any other streaming platform. Spotify Wrapped just came out and my top three artists this yera are Drake, Beabadoobee, and Kanye West. I had approximately 57,000 minutes this year a significant decrease from my 90,000 minutes in 2022. My favorite hike of all time would be Blanca Lake located in the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness Area in the Cascade Mountains. The green water is just so beautiful ðŸ™‚.</p>
