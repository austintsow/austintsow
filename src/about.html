            <p id="aboutTextBio">Hello, I am Austin Tsow! I am a current undergraduate student
               pursuing computer science, based in Sammamish, Washington, but currently in Spokane, 
               Washington. I am a highly motivated, result-oriented individual passionate about 
               building innovative software solutions.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">In my previous roles, I have demonstrated my ability to learn new 
              technologies, as well as systems and operations. In my role as a Data Analyst at Century 21, 
              I was responsible for analyzing real estate listings by pulling data from local multiple 
              listing services (MLS) into Excel. I used this data to provide daily updates on real estate 
              activity locally, including new listings, pending sales, and sold properties. As a waiter at 
              Shanghai Garden, I developed a new system to improve restaurant operations which resulted 
              in a 35% increase in overall efficiency.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">I have experience in various programming languages such as C++, Java, 
              Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with debugging, Linux, full-stack web development, 
              and backend software development. My skills have enabled me to build websites, small projects, 
              and solve complex problems using machine learning. I am passionate about using technology to 
              make a positive impact on the world—specifically, areas of education, healthcare, and sustainability.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="aboutMidDiv">
            <p id="aboutTextBio">I am an inclusive, disciplined, and resilient individual. My favorite color is 
              yellow. I am born and raised  in the suburbs of Washington, immersed in Taiwanese culture. I have always 
              been involved in some  sort of physical activity. After playing football for 10 years as 
              I started my college career in computer science. Technology's potential to positively impact 
              the world has always fascinated me. I am interested more in the back-end of software 
              development and engineering. I hope to first finish my Bachelor's degree, then become a Software Engineer. 
              With that being the reason why I chose to study Computer Science. I believe that there isn't 
              anything I can't do, and anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing.</p>

            <h2 id="aboutTextBelowBio">what i do on my free time!</h2>
          </div>
          <div id="aboutMidDiv">
            <p id="aboutTextBio">In my leisure hours, I indulge in a variety of activities that fuel both my intellect
               and spirit. From culinary adventures in the kitchen to embarking on serene hikes amidst nature's grandeur
               , I find solace and inspiration in diverse pursuits.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">One of my greatest passions is programming. I sometimes use programming to solve some
               of my everyday issues, the most recently being a script that I wrote to refresh my mind on converting
                binary to decimal and vice versa. Programming is a craft that endlessly fascinates me, offering 
                boundless opportunities for creativity and problem-solving. When I'm not immersed in the digital 
                realm, you might find me lost in the pages of a captivating book (<a href="books.html" id="to-external">more here</a>) or exploring the sonic 
                landscapes of my favorite music.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">When it comes to music, my allegiance lies firmly with Spotify. As a Spotify user 
              for over 10 years of my life, I can tell you so much about it if you asked me. At the year end, I had 
              a total of 57,000 minutes to my name, which is a significant decrease from my 90,000 in 2022. My 
              current favorite artists are Drake, Lil Yachty, Laufey Wave to Earth, and Beabadoobee.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">Aside from digital symphonies and literary voyages, I find an unparalleled joy in 
              the embrace of nature (<a href="hikes.html" id="to-external">more here</a>). Notable hikes being, 
              Annette Lake, Mt. Si (the big one), and Blanca Lake. 
              My favorite being Blanca Lake which is nestled in the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness Area. Its 
              emerald waters shimmering beneath the Cascade Mountains evoke a sense of wonder and tranquility 
              that will forever hold a spot with me.</p>
            <p id="aboutTextBio">Through all adventures with the company of my beloved girlfriend, Wynne. Whether it 
              may be  venturing into the great outdoors or relishing quiet moments at home, I find fulfillment in 
              the simple joys of companionship and shared experiences. As the seasons change, I eagerly anticipate 
              the discoveries that await, both within and beyond the confines of everyday life.</p>
